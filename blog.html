              <p class="text-2xl font-bold">var is the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable. x is the name of that variable. = is the operator that tells JavaScript a value is coming up next. 100 is the value for the variable to store.</p>

              <p class="text-2xl font-bold">The keyword let in Javascript is used to declare a variable that is block scoped in JavaScript. In JavaScript, the var keyword is typically used to declare a variable that is treated like any other variable, whereas variables declared using the let in JavaScript are block scoped.</p>

              <p class="text-2xl font-bold">const declarations are scoped to blocks as well as functions.
                const declarations can only be accessed after the place of declaration is reached (see temporal dead zone). For this reason, const declarations are commonly regarded as non-hoisted.
                const declarations do not create properties on globalThis when declared at the top level of a script.</p>

              <p class="text-2xl font-bold">The null keyword in JavaScript is a falsy data type that denotes that the data type is null. Falsy type refers to the coercion of null to false during conditional statement executions.
              Null is an object in JavaScript and represents primitive data types. A  null value in JavaScript is used for referring absence of any object  value and if any function or variable returns null, then we can infer  that the object could not be created. If we pass null as the default  parameter to any function type it would take the ‘null’ as a value  passed to it.</p>

              <p class="text-2xl font-bold">A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope.
              In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable,  non-writable property. Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding  it.

              <p class="text-2xl font-bold">An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
              First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his  doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level of  flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one  reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting  components and applications in a microservices architecture.</p>
